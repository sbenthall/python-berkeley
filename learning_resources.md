## Asking questions

The best place to ask questions is our [IRC channel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) chat room on [Freenode](https://freenode.net/): **#pyworkparty**

There are many ways to get into an IRC chat room, but the easiest is to use [this web client](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#pyworkparty). Just click [here](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#pyworkparty), enter your Nickname, fill out the Captcha to verify that you are a human being, and you will join the channel. We're friendly folks who are there to help, so please feel free to ask questions!

Quickly you may discover that some ways of asking questions are better than others. [This](http://mattgemmell.com/what-have-you-tried/) is a nice article with some good ideas about this.


If there is nobody in the channel to answer your question, you should try just Googling it.

Often there are good answers on [Stack
Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com). If you don't find the answer to your question there, you can sign up and ask for help there!

There is a long history in open source developer culture of asking questions and learning how to ask questions. People on Stack Overflow are part of this tradition. If you start engaging that community (which is a great idea) and want to learn more, you could read the ["tour" for
Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/tour) or this more in-depth [essay on
asking good questions by Eric
Raymond](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) - note that Eric DOES
NOT want questions from anyone (unless he finds them in a forum)!

You're always welcome to
ask questions on the [mailing list](https://calmail.berkeley.edu/manage/list/listinfo/py4science@lists.berkeley.edu).

## Zero-installation intros

These resources include an integrated python interpreter that
works through your web browser. To use the other resources, you'll
need to get access to a python interpreter (described in the next
section).

 - [Codecademy Python Track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python)
 - [learnpython.org](http://www.learnpython.org/)
 - [Code Wars](http://www.codewars.com)

## Intro materials on GitHub

 - [Dav's D-Lab materials](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/python-fundamentals)
 - [Omoju's Hip Hop / Turtle curriculum](https://github.com/davclark/ultra_scrapr)

## Getting Python

Simple consoles: [PySchools](http://doc.pyschools.com/console) and [Codecademy
Labs](http://labs.codecademy.com)

The **easy** way, hosted IPython in your browser: [Wakari.io](http://wakari.io)

If you are using OS X or Linux (or similar), you likely already have Python
installed. You can just run `python` from the command line. (If you don't know
how to run things from the command line, it's probably easiest to start with the
Wakari link above, so you only have one thing to learn! If you want more of a
power-user experience then you can start with the [Command Line Crash
Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/).)

If you install Python, you should follow [the instructions on
the IPython page](http://ipython.org/install.html). (IPython is an enhanced shell for Python.)

## E-books

 - [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.html)
 - [6 Free ebooks for python](http://readwrite.com/2011/03/25/python-is-an-increasingly-popu)
 - [Python for Data Analysis](http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/python/9781449323592)
   (a great intro to real scientific computing with Python)
 - At Berkeley, we have access to the following e-book catalogs (which includes the Data Analysis book above):
    - [O'Reilly Safari Bookshelf](http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/)
    - [Springer Link](http://link.springer.com/search?facet-content-type=%22Book%22)

## Other topics

A general resource when you're exploring new topics is the [Hitchhiker's Guide
to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/). (Just like this site, you
can [contribute to the Hitchhiker's Guide via
GitHub](https://github.com/kennethreitz/python-guide).)

[Python for Data Analysis](http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/python/9781449323592) is a great place to get started.
Or, you can learn about these tools from their websites:

 - [Pandas for reading / manipulating data](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
 - [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/index.html) (the most common graphing library, includes a great
   [gallery](http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html))

And then look here for inspiration:

 - [View existing IPython notebooks](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/)
 - [A list of other interesting IPython notebooks](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks)

# At Berkeley
UC Berkeley has a lot of great resources for learning scientific computing and
data science.  There are classes, tutorials, reading groups, institutes, and
much more.  Below are some things worth checking out:

## Scientific computing resources at UC Berkeley
- [The D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu)
- [The I-school masters in data science](http://datascience.berkeley.edu)
- [The Berkeley Institute for Data Science (more details soon)](http://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/datascience/bids-launch-dec-12)
- [The Berkeley VC for research page on data science](http://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/datascience)

## Python Courses at UC Berkeley
- [CS9H](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~selfpace/class/cs9h/index.shtml) - Self-paced Python course. Requires some programming background. Good for people that know another language and want to pick up Python.
- [AY250](http://profjsb.github.io/python-seminar/) - "Python computing for science." More advanced python course for scientists.

## Intensives

Software carpentry offers a variety of trainings around the world, check their
[main site](http://software-carpentry.org/bootcamps/index.html) for bootcamp
dates.
